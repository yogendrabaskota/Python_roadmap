# List is made when we want to store different data with a single name.
# the data is only differentiated by its index number. (indexing can be positive e.g 1,2,3 and negative -1,-2)
# Lists are ordered and separated by , and enclosed in [ ].
# Lists are mutable.
# Lists can have multiple data types. string and int in the same list but its not recommended.
# if can be used to check if a data is available in the list. # List comprehension means generating lists during execution of program. conditions can also be given
